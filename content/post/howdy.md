Hi - I’m Rhys and I’m slightly obsessed with making everything in my house have an IP address even when it shouldn’t.

I have always had way to much interest in consumer electronics and from an early age loved tinkering with stuff, this has translated into 


**Stuff with an IP or IP accessable on my network today;**

* Google Wifi Access Points
* Philips Hue Lights and Bridge
* Lots of LIFX (different Gen bulbs)
* Mi Acquara Gateway, motion sensors, temperature sensors and door sensors
* Ring Gen 1 Video doorbell 
* Apple TV
* HomePod
* Chromecast(s)
* Nest Cameras (IQ, Outdoor and Origional)
* Bunch of Raspberry Pi’s (different Gens) doing different things
* Synology DS412+
* Google Home and Google Home Mini’s
* Mi Flower Sensor
* Nintendo Switch
* Xbox One
* Kogan TV's (never ever purchase Kogan stuff)
