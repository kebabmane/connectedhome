Wow, this looks really good

So, I have been living in two smart home ecosystems for a while now - Apple's HomeKit and Google, with each having pros and cons.

One thing I was kinda annoyed about with the Apple approach was my need for a shared device - for guests and those times your phone isn't close by - how can I give you a glance into the smart home. Something I found on reddit was my original plan....

Now technically this is fine, looks kinda okay and would do the job but would see me needing to purchase a new (ish) iPad and a stand it's going to set me back around $470 AUD - and I probably want to end up with one or two around the house so this comes in closer to $1000 once I add a stand or holder.

My main problem with the iPad(s) is that I would most probably need to create a new apple ID, invite it to my family apple account and then add them to HomeKit, along with handing out a shared pin for everyone OR not locking the screen which doesn't quite feel right OR just give everyone my pin to that home pad.

At first glance of the features this thing could fill a gap for me;

* Looks great (way better then an iPad on the stand)
* Supports "family" usage right out of the box
* Integrates nicely with the existing Google Home devices I already have
* Price point that allows for a few to be scattered around the house ($219 AUD)
* Ships in Australia late October (we are a launch country)

The other thing I really like about the Google Home Hub is the Smart Home Controls look clean, easy to use and not as cluttered as the Apple Home app can when you have loads of devices

I'll be picking one up on launch week and will give you all a review
