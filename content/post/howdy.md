description: Introduction to me, all the stuff I have wasted money on and things that break at 2am

Hi - I’m Rhys and I’m slightly obsessed with making everything in my house have an IP address even when it shouldn’t.

I have always had way to much interest in consumer electronics and from an early age loved tinkering with stuff, this has translated into my adult life with an obsession with IoT devices and more importantly trying to build the perfect smart home.

At the moment i'm renting, however hopefully in late 2018 or early 2019 our new house will be ready and I plan to implement a huge amount of home automation which I intend to outline here in this blog over the coming months. In the mean time I will tell you a bit about the tech I have around the house, along with reviews of the kit purchased (haven't found many review sites focused on Australia)


**Stuff with an IP or IP accessible on my network today;**

* Google Wifi Access Points
* Philips Hue Lights and Bridge
* Lots of LIFX (different Gen bulbs)
* Mi Acquara Gateway, motion sensors, temperature sensors and door sensors
* Ring Gen 1 Video doorbell 
* Apple TV
* HomePod
* Chromecast(s)
* Nest Cameras (IQ, Outdoor and Origional)
* Bunch of Raspberry Pi’s (different Gens) doing different things
* Synology DS412+
* Google Home and Google Home Mini’s
* Mi Flower Sensor
* Nintendo Switch
* Xbox One
* Kogan TV's (never ever purchase Kogan stuff)


Today, we are primarily an Apple household so we went with HomeKit/Siri as the main interface to the above devices, generally using the homebridge project to bring stuff into HomeKit that was never designed for compatibility. This has served us well however my partner *hates* siri so we have a bunch of Google Home Mini's around the house that we use for voice command and control of the automation's.

I have one raspberry Pi running the homebridge server and another running home assistant [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) - most things today are through homebridge & homekit however I like keeping a log of everything and home-assistant has that feature.

Something i'll make sure to include in most of the reviews is some notes from my partner - she loves the IoT stuff *when it works* and she will make sure to give the review and opinion from the non-tech perspective.

Cheers
Rhys
