It cost alot and does very little

Yeah so I got a HomePod - I needed a sound bar for the awful Kogan TV I purchased (two main issues - shitty/slow software that you cant disable and audio that sounds like people are permenantly underwater) - the sound issues caused my SO crazy and demanded I fixed it somehow, so I trundled down to the local JB Hifi - found the HomePods, dusted one off (seriously, I asked the team behind the counter and they had sold zero so the unit I grabbed had been sitting on a shelf since launch date just gathering dust) and paid my $500 AUD.

### The Good

* Sound is clear and crisp
* HomeKit commands work really really fast
* Apple TV Integration is pretty good, but needs some work
* Timers work well (you would hope so for $500 AUD)
* iOS 12 Brings some new functionality (make phone calls, multiple timers, etc...) 

### The Bad

- Lots of functionality (like HomeKit) is disabled when I leave home, meaning my SO who is on the Apple Family Account and I have invited to HomeKit cannot use it - wtf?
- Same goes for reminders - we have a shared shopping list and of course once I leave the safety of Wifi no one can add anything to a shopping (or other list) 
- No voice match means that it’s tied to a single iOS/iCloud Account
- Siri is okay but is missing huge chunks of functionality when compared to Google Assistant (the other Voice AI in my life)
- The fabric is lovely but is a huge magnet for just stuff to stick to it (I have a toddler so she makes sures to touch it after dinner)
- When you have configured the Apple TV to use the HomePod for sound, whenever you use the HomePod (like to play some music) it will fire up your Apple TV, with HDMI-CEC it means by TV is always turning on....
- For some reason when using the Apple TV and HomePod together the max volume is limited below what it would be standalone
- No 3.5m or other audio in exists so it can only be used with the Apple TV - my Xbox and Nintendo switch don’t sound great

Unboxing the HomePod and setup are pretty easy, bring your iPhone close to the unit and let Bluetooth Pairing take over the rest, all in all in took around 20 minutes to setup including the mandatory iOS update on the HomePod, next came the fun bits...

At this point (a few months ago) iOS 12 hadn’t been released and the Apple TV interface to always audio out to the HomePod was buried deep in a few menus, once I had found the setting and changed the default it worked really well.

Sounds are crisp, no more underwater sounding people - max volume is still a little dim but good enough, volume works through the Apple TV remote (the Kogan doesn’t support volume changes with the Apple TV remote).

However a few things really spoil what is otherwise a good device; 

**first up the 2(ish) second delay...**

So when you select the HomePod as an audio output, it can take quite a few seconds to switch on over, during this time your show is paused and you just have to wait for it to sync up. If your lucky after a few seconds the show will start playing, if your unlucky (which happens to be quite a bit) your app will crash and you need to start the process all over again.

Also if you have used the HomePod for just playing audio in between watching TV shows it will be in a disconnected state and you will need to start playing some media, then change the audio output - happens to us quite a bit.

**secondly no HomeKit when I’m not home...**

Really? This sounds rather insane to me, for a device thats meant to be sitting in homes, where generally a few people will live, there is no option at all to allow HomeKit control from the device when I’m out of the home, not even if someone is on your shared/family AppleID or you have invited them to home kit (so my SO needs to use Siri on her phone, but cant because the HomePod hears her first so she needs to fall back to using the Home app which takes more steps and interaction)

I get needing to ensure security, but not any form of optionality at all? Just a blanket no.... I guess Apple would prefer I just purchase a HomePod for everyone in the house.... (or I hope they release an update sooner rather then later that fixes this)

**thirdly wow this thing is pricey**

Look, I know it’s not the purpose of the device but the HomePod has been way better at detecting “hey siri” then our phones (iPhone X and iPhone 8 Plus) so we have been using it heaps more (when I’m home) for HomeKit automations - but it would be nice to have one in every room at a price point (and sound quality level) that makes sense, doesn’t need to be super cheap (anything under $150 is acceptable to me) but walking into a room and saying “turn on/off the lights” is really really great in practice and the current size plus limitations of the HomePod don’t make it a “Smart Speaker”

I haven’t purchased a second unit for testing the stereo pairing feature, however as I’m thinking about the new house and home theatre room, at this point i’m not sure the sound at the price point is what I’m after (the current thinking is some Sonos gear but more research needs to be done) - good enough for a family room TV but not good enough for a home theatre room.

### Conclusion

Like every other review I read before I purchased this unit, you could only recommend the HomePod to someone firmly in the Apple Ecosystem (or walled garden depending on your view) - however as someone who is in the ecosystem, honestly I still think I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone else - wait for iOS 13 or some other updates for thinking about investing in one.
